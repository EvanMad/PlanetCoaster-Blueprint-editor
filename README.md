# Planet Coaster Blueprint Editor
Very basic coaster type changer with other minor features

## How it works
Open the GUI, go to settings > dir and select you planet coaster folder (the one with the planet coaster.exe in). Then go File > Open and select a coaster blueprint folder
Edit it to your hearts content, then go file > Inject. From there open planet coaster and open the in game "Trail Blazer" blueprint, this should be your edited blueprint
Note: It doesn't save to the original blueprint.

### Notes
Loads of errors and bugs still, anyone is welcome to come in and fix
I don't plan to develop this much more, likely going to re-write into a new program when I know more about the track data so watch out for that!
